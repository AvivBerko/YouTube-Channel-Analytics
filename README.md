# YouTube Channel Analytics: Impact of Upload Timing on Viewer Engagement

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between the timing of video uploads and viewer engagement on YouTube. By analyzing data from multiple channels, the project aims to provide insights into how upload timing affects metrics like views, likes, and subscriber growth.

**Guiding Question:** _"How does the timing of video uploads impact viewer engagement and channel growth?"_

## Key Insights
- **Regular Upload Schedules:** Channels that consistently upload videos at regular and most important - short intervals tend to see steady growth in engagement and subscribers.
- **Peak Upload Times:** Uploading videos during peak times (e.g., afternoons, monday/thursday) leads to higher engagement.
- **Video Duration**: Shorter videos may perform better in terms of engagement.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Strong correlations were found between upload timing and engagement metrics, emphasizing the importance of strategic timing for content creators.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Data Collection:** Data gathered from the YouTube API, focusing on upload times and engagement metrics.
2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and preprocessing of data to ensure accuracy.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial analysis to understand data distribution and patterns.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Examination of relationships between upload timing and engagement.
5. **Trend Analysis:** Identification of trends in engagement and growth over time.
6. **Comparative Analysis:** Comparison of timing effects across different channels.
7. **Conclusion:** Summary of findings and actionable insights for content creators.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** Visualization libraries for creating plots and charts.
- **YouTube Data API v3:** API used to collect data from YouTube.
